            <p>The Cromwell College Athletics Day is an annual sports ceremony that takes place at Cromwell College. usually around mid Feburary. This sports day includes all the classic track and field events, such as the 100m, 400m , high jump, and many more. Competition isn't the only factor at play, as many participation events take place, with the opportunity for students to earn points for their house. At the start of the day, students dress flamboyantly in the colours of their respective house, and participate in the iconic house march. This is a competition where students march past several judges, shouting their chant for their house. The house with the best attitude and power for their chant wins, receiving a large amount of points, giving them a big head start towards winning the overall competition.</p>
